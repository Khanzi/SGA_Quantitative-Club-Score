# Using the Downloader

The downloader is intended to process batch calculation.
You will need to upload an appropriatley formatted document.

**Things to note**

The default downloaded file from the main page needs modification in order to be used in the download section.

The downloaded will not display calculations live but the downloaded version will reflect calculations made.

The downloader will encorporate weights specified in the *Weights* tab.

The downloaded csv will have an additional dummy column called Cat_Bonus. Contrary to the common intuitition this is not a bonus applied to clubs who encorporate felines into their regular activities. It's simply a product of the calculations.

## Required Columns
The **exact** column names must be in the uploaded CSV

```r
1	Club_Name
2	Category
3	Monthly_Meetings
4	Budget_Percentage_Used
5	Missing_Late_Paperwork
6	Monthly_Meetings_Missed
7	Missing_Broken_Assets
8	General_Meetings
9	Avg_Attendance
10	Eboard_Meetings
11	Events
12	Event_Attendance
13	Club_Performance
14	Meeting_Score
15	Total
```



## Issues
> It's saying I have the wrong file type but my columns are correct.. I quadruple checked!!!

It's probably not a CSV.

> I just can't get it to work!
